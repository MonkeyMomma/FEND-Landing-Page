# Karin M. Davis Landing Page Project

This project is the second project in the Udacity Front End Developer NanoDegree Program. I do not recommend Udacity's Programs, however. Their "reviewers" are sexist and have repeatedly accused me of plagerism for submitting my own work. Even if there is only simularities caused by using industry recommended coding styles and layouts, they will accuse of plagerism, especially if you are female. Because of this, I was not able to complete my Nanodegree. I do not recommend giving Udacity any of your hard earned money.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
