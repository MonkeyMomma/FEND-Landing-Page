        <h2>Unicorns Dream?</h2>
        <p>Recent increases in unicorn population numbers in the world have given researchers a wonderful new opportunity to study this elusive creature. While Muggles are quarantined around the world, mythical creatures of all kinds have increased in numbers and been easier to find in the wild. Previously only seen regularly in the Forbidden Forest of Hogwarts and the woods of Ilvermorny, wild unicorns are now being seen in all parts of America. There have long been reports of them appearing to very young Muggles and a group of Muggles who identify as "Crafters", but now, they are openly seen by many in both the Muggle and Wizard Communities. </p>

        <p>Here at the Scamander and Kowalski Institute, we have wondered what unicorns dream about since the days of our founder and namesake Newt Scamander's research into the Fantastic Beasts of the World. It is well known that many humans, Wizard and Muggle alike, dream about Unicorns, but our everlasting curiosity has us wondering what unicorns dream about. Observations of sleeping unicorns have indicated they do, in fact, dream, but the content of those dreams have been a mystery.</p>

        <p>With this sudden spike in Unicorn sightings, we have been fortunate to capture a family of unicorns to study. These animals were found attempting to feed outside of a closed Muggle Trinkets and Notions shop called Micheal's, in Northern California. It has been long speculated that Unicorns feed off positive emotions as well as vegetation, we here at the S.K. Insititute believe the positive energy these Muggle "Crafters" have as they leave these shops draws the Unicorns to these locations. We rounded up the unicorns to care for them while the positive energy levels in the Muggle Community are so low.</p>

        <h2>Pensieve Altered to Capture Unicorn Dreams</h2>
        <p>After only two weeks of work, S.K. Institute researcher and Muggleborn boy genius, Harrold Dursley, first cousin, once removed, to the famous Harry Potter, discovered a method to alter a Pensieve to allow humans to view the dreams of Unicorns. This incredible work, combined with the exceptional luck of having a family of unicorns in capitivity briefly, has allow the Institute to see what Unicorns are dreaming about. </p>

        <p>The Institute will be releasing a full report on the findings when the study is completed, but preliminary results have shown that unicorns do, in fact, dream, and like humans, their dreams vary from night to night and creature to creature. Dursley and his team are excited to continue their studies into the dreams. They has released some of the themes of the dreams.</p>

    <section id="section3" data-nav="Young Unicorns' Dreams">
      <div class="landing__container">
        <h2>Young Unicorns' Dreams</h2>
        <p>Our family of Unicorns consists of an adult male, adult female, and two young unicorns. One of the younglings is a male, approximately two years old. The other is a female, approximately six months old. The younglings have very interesting dreams. We speculate this family of unicorns has spent most of their lives living in an emplty field near the Muggle shop. The Muggles have many streets that they use their "automobiles" on in the area.</p>

        <p>The young male's dreams are of these Muggle travel devices, however, they appear as a mixture of the Muggle "automobiles" and dragons. The dreams vary each night, however, there is a common theme of the young male being chased by these dragon automobiles. The young female tends to dream only of colors. Her dreams have been marked by imagery of sparkly bits of colors, cascading across a human hand.  We believe this sparkly bits are the substance the Muggle "Crafters" refer to as "Glitter", "Evil Craft", or "Craft Herpes". Research Lead Dursley indicates that his Muggle grandmother, Petunia, states the substance is a messy ingredient in crafts that is not allowed in her home.</p>

    <section id="section4" data-nav="Adult Unicorn Dreams">
      <div class="landing__container">
        <h2> Adult Unicorn Dreams </h2>
        <p> The adult Female had rather interesting dreams. Most of her dreams the past week have been of male unicorns running through tranquil forests. A member of our team noted that it does not appear the male unicorn of the family is in any of the groups seen in the dreams. We feel more study is needed to determine if any meaning can be derived from that.</p>

        <p> Our reseach team lead Dursley has a unique perspective as a Muggleborn who is still too young to attend any wizarding schools, yet full of talent. He still spends quite a bit of time at his home with his father. His father enjoys the entertainment programming on the Muggle "television", and thus our young Dursley has watched quite a few of these shows. He states the Adult Male Unicorn's dreams appear to show the Adult male being a member of many of the various fire suppression teams the Muggles watch on the device, called firefighters. We believe this may indicate the Adult Male would like to be a Unicorn member of one of these teams. <p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p> While the team has not yet come to a definitive conclusion on the content of all unicorns' dreams, the initial research done of one family of unicorns from one location appears to show unicorns do dream. We are pleased that we have developed a method to retrieve these dreams and look forward to further research with subjects from various areas. As our research into Unicorn dreams develops, we also hope to expand to other Magical Creatures. </p>
